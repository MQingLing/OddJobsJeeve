# OddJobs Jeeve

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

OddJobs Jeeve is made with the purpose for entertainment. This is a platformer game with a story concept that follows a small puffle creature called Jeeve and its journey through adult life where they would have to work hard juggling their many jobs just to survive in this competitive society. 

In each Stage, it follows a different theme. For example, Stage 1 would have a fast food worker theme where the background and items would be representative of a fast food restaurant such as fries and burgers. Stage 2 would have a laundry worker theme where the background and items would be representative of a laundromat such as dirty shirts and pants and so on. 

For the gameplay, it follows a simple platformer type mechanic where the player would move Jeeve and jump on platforms to collect the items. Each item would have their own points which would be colour coded. The red item would be +20 points, the blue item would be +10 points, the yellow item would be +5 points. 

The players points and username would be stored in database via api. If they are in the top 20, their highscore would be available to be seen for all players that played the game.  at the end of each level.
 
## Design Process
 
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
